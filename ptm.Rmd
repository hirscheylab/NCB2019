This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) notebook accompanying a review on protein modifications. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code and Figures will be save to the working directory. 

##Load libraries
```{r load_block, warning=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
library(tidyverse)
library(janitor)
library(viridis)
library(XML)
library(feather)
library(rmarkdown)
library(beepr) #long analysis; get some coffee, and comeback when ready
library(patchwork)

#clear environment
#rm(list=ls()) 

#print Session information for provenance and reproducibility
utils:::print.sessionInfo(sessionInfo()[-8]) 
#You can remove an item from sessionInfo(), which is a list with a class attribute, by printing the resulting object omitting one of the list items (omitted list of packages installed, but not loaded)

#Set theme
theme_set(theme_light())
```

##Figure 3a
Overall goal is to quanitfy known landscape of protein amino acids. Chose to get data from Uniprot, as a comprehensive and validated resouce containing data for human proteins. 
```{r fig1}

#skip 48 first lines which contain data file dictionary

#URL points to a datafile, to increase reproducibility; datafile is also downloaded 12/21/2018 and saved in working data directory in case URL link breaks
#alt
#ptm_raw <- read_tsv("data/ptmlist.txt", col_names = FALSE, skip = 48)

#make working df
ptm <- ptm_raw %>% 
  separate(X1, c("key", "value"), sep = 3) %>% 
  mutate(id = if_else(grepl("ID", key), value, NA_character_)) %>% #must call NA_char so that fill fxn works
  fill(id) #need fill fxn to populate ids across all observations, so that spread can work

#clean more
ptm$key <- str_trim(ptm$key, side = "right") #use stringr pkg to remove white space *janitor works on colnames only

#drop rows, duplicate rows are causing problems with spread, and don't need them
ptm <- ptm %>%

#ptm_dup <- get_dupes(ptm, key_id)
#I check the ptm_dup df and made to sure to drop the keys that had more than one entry (immediate preceeding code chunk)

#spread data
ptm <- ptm %>% 
  spread(key, value) #not clever names, but appropriate

#gives a tibble of 645 observations, therefore 645 unique PTMs

#This code snippet give me the total number of unique modifications, with CROSSLINK removed; total is 498. But I know the list doens't include 3 recently published modifications discovered by our group, plus a few others by YMZ (considering this a lag in DB updating), so OK to conclude over 500.

##Figure 3b
Goal is to determine how these modifications are distributed; thought it'd be interesting to visualize by average added mass (MA) to a protein, with several small changes in molecular mass, with some very large additions of mass
```{r fig2}
fig3b <- ptm %>%
  filter(!FT == "CROSSLNK") %>% #omit AA cross links only
  ggplot() +
  #geom_point(aes(x = MA, y =0, color = fct_lump(KW, 0)), shape = "|", size = 15, alpha = 1/2) +
  geom_density(aes(x = MA, ..scaled.., color = fct_lump(KW,0))) +
  geom_rug(aes(x = MA, y = 0, color = fct_lump(KW,0)), sides = "b", alpha = 1/2, position = "jitter", size = 1) + 
  labs(x = "Mass Appended (Da)", y = "Distribtution of Modifications (scaled)") +
  scale_color_viridis(discrete = TRUE, direction = 1) +
  scale_y_continuous(limits = c(0,1)) + 
  theme(legend.position = "") +
  NULL

#save plot
ggsave("output/fig3b.pdf", plot = last_plot(), width = 5, height = 5, dpi = 600)

#the reason some average masses (MA) are so abundant is because you find the same modifications across several AAs, thereby weighting some more
#NB several glycans and lipids are variable masses, and therefore are entered as NA, so not reflected in the graph

ptm %>%
  filter(!FT == "CROSSLNK") %>% #omit AA cross links only
  count(KW, sort = TRUE)

#combine figures for editor
fig3ab <- 
  fig3a + fig3b +
  plot_annotation(tag_levels = 'A')

##AA Analyses
###Lysine Analysis
In this code chunk, the goal is to count and summarize lysine modifications.
```{r lysine}
ptm %>% 
  filter(!FT == "CROSSLNK") %>% #omit AA cross links only
  filter(TG == "Lysine") %>% 
  count(ID, sort = TRUE)

#code chunk to make a tibble that is easy to view all attributes; no need to save as an object in environment
ptm %>% 
  filter(!FT == "CROSSLNK") %>% #omit AA cross links only
  filter(TG == "Lysine") %>% 
  arrange(MA) #sorts by mass, low to high
```

###Cysteine Analysis
In this code chunk, the goal is to count and summarize cysteine modifications. Counted 57 (as of Feb 2019), however does not include 3 published modifiations: succination, 2,3-dicarboxylpropylation (i.e. itaconylation), or s-acetylation, so OK to conclude 60, at least.
```{r cysteine}
ptm %>% 
  filter(!FT == "CROSSLNK") %>% #omit AA cross links only
  filter(TG == "Cysteine") %>% 
  count(ID, sort = TRUE)

#code chunk to make a tibble that is easy to view all attributes; no need to save as an object in environment
ptm %>% 
  filter(!FT == "CROSSLNK") %>% #omit AA cross links only
  filter(TG == "Cysteine") %>% 
  arrange(MA) #sorts by mass, low to high
```
###Serine Analysis
In this code chunk, the goal is to count and summarize serine modifications. Counted 70 (as of Feb 2019). 
```{r serine}
ptm %>% 
  filter(!FT == "CROSSLNK") %>% #omit AA cross links only
  filter(TG == "Serine") %>% 
  count(ID, sort = TRUE)

ptm %>% 
  filter(!FT == "CROSSLNK") %>% #omit AA cross links only
  filter(TG == "Threonine") %>% 
  count(ID, sort = TRUE)

ptm %>% 
  filter(!FT == "CROSSLNK") %>% #omit AA cross links only
  filter(TG == "Tyrosine") %>% 
  count(ID, sort = TRUE)

ptm %>% 
  filter(!FT == "CROSSLNK") %>% #omit AA cross links only
  filter(TG == "Serine") %>% 
  filter(str_detect(CF, "P")) %>% 
  count(ID, sort = TRUE)
#13 serine modifications contain phosphate (12 carbon-phosphate, 1 phosphate only)

#code chunk to make a tibble that is easy to view all attributes; no need to save as an object in environment
ptm %>% 
  filter(!FT == "CROSSLNK") %>% #omit AA cross links only
  filter(TG == "Serine") %>% 
  arrange(MA) #sorts by mass, low to high
```

###Phenylalanine Analysis
In this code chunk, the goal is to count and summarize phenylalanine modifications. Counted 5 (as of Feb 2019); 1?
```{r phenylalanine}
ptm %>% 
  filter(!FT == "CROSSLNK") %>% #omit AA cross links only
  filter(TG == "Phenylalanine") %>% 
  arrange(MA) #sorts by mass, low to high
```

###Protein Backbone Analysis
In this code chunk, the goal is to count and summarize backbone modifications. First look at backbone alone; next look at the part of the protein where these are ascribed; then look at distribution of all backbone modifications on amino acids (glycine is the most); but, these are all n- or c-term modifications; if you look at protien core modifications, these are all serine/threonine/tyrosine and cysteine.
```{r backbone}
ptm %>% 
  filter(!FT == "CROSSLNK") %>% #omit AA cross links only
  filter(str_detect(PA, "backbone")) %>% 
  arrange(MA) #sorts by mass, low to high

ptm %>% 
  filter(!FT == "CROSSLNK") %>% #omit AA cross links only
  filter(str_detect(PA, "backbone")) %>% 
  count(PA, sort = TRUE)

ptm %>% 
  filter(!FT == "CROSSLNK") %>% #omit AA cross links only
  filter(str_detect(PA, "backbone")) %>% 
  count(PP, sort = TRUE)

ptm %>% 
  filter(!FT == "CROSSLNK") %>% #omit AA cross links only
  filter(str_detect(PA, "backbone")) %>% 
  count(TG, sort = TRUE)

ptm %>% 
  filter(!FT == "CROSSLNK") %>% #omit AA cross links only
  filter(str_detect(PA, "backbone")) %>% 
  filter(TG == "Glycine")

ptm %>% 
  filter(!FT == "CROSSLNK") %>% #omit AA cross links only
  filter(str_detect(PA, "backbone")) %>% 
  filter(str_detect(PP, "core")) %>% 
  count(TG, sort = TRUE)

ptm %>% 
  filter(!FT == "CROSSLNK") %>% #omit AA cross links only
  filter(str_detect(PA, "backbone")) %>% 
  filter(str_detect(PP, "core")) %>% 
  arrange(TG)
```

##Figure 4

##Acyl-phosphate Analysis
Code chunk to count acyl-phosphates. 10 total counted, although strangely two are listed at 266 Da. Same or different?

##Figure 5
In this figure, the goal is to determine how many reactive [human] metabolites there are and to determine how many are associated with PTMs
```{r fig5a}
#count thioesters
thioester <- metabolites %>% 
  filter(str_detect(smiles, "C\\(=O\\)S") | str_detect(smiles, "SC\\(=O\\)")) %>% #regex the smiles code for thioesters at either orientation
  arrange(average_molecular_weight) %>% 
  mutate(type = "Thioester") %>% 
  mutate(pre_post = if_else(str_detect(smiles, "C\\(=O\\)S"), "pre", "post")) %>% 
  separate(smiles, into = c("pre_smiles", "post_smiles"), sep = "S", remove = FALSE, extra = "merge" ) %>%  #merge is to prevent discarding data "Expected 2 pieces. Additional pieces discarded in 26 rows"
  mutate(added_carbons = if_else(grepl("pre", pre_post), str_count(pre_smiles, "C"), str_count(post_smiles, "C"))) #entry errors
  
#because the smiles code has thioesters with orientations that could add carbon on either sides of the code, the first mutate adds a pre_post column to indicate which side will be added; then the separate will split at the thiol; then the last mutate will count the number of carbons in either the pre or post column, depending.

#these include all from CoA list, except "CoA-"
#anti_join(CoA, thioester, by = "name")
#semi_join(CoA, thioester, by = "name") leaves 355, which is one less than in the CoA df
