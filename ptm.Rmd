This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) notebook accompanying the invited review on reactive activate carbon species, protein modifications, and carbon stress. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code and Figures will be save to the working directory.

##Figure 1
Overall goal is to quanitfy known landscape of protein amino acids. Chose to get data from Uniprot, as a comprehensive and validated resouce containing data for human proteins. 
```{r}
ptm_raw <- read_tsv("https://www.uniprot.org/docs/ptmlist.txt", col_names = FALSE, skip = 48) #skip 48 first lines which contain data file dictionary

#URL points to a datafile, to increase reproducibility; datafile is also saved and downloaded 12/21/2018 in working directory in case URL link breaks

#make working df
ptm <- ptm_raw %>% 
  separate(X1, c("key", "value"), sep = 3) %>% 
  mutate(id = if_else(grepl("ID", key), value, NA_character_)) %>% #must call NA_char so that fill fxn works
  fill(id) #need fill fxn to populate ids across all observations, so that spread can work

#clean more
ptm$key <- str_trim(ptm$key, side = "right") #use stringr pkg to remove white space *janitor works on colnames only

#drop rows, duplicate rows are causing problems with spread, and don't need them
ptm <- ptm %>% 
  filter(!key %in% c("//", "TR", "DR", "---"))
  
#This is code I used to ensure that there were no duplicates
#ptm <- ptm %>%
#  unite(key_id, c("key", "id"), sep = "_", remove = FALSE)
#ptm_dup <- get_dupes(ptm, key_id)
#I check the ptm_dup df and made to sure to drop the keys that had more than one entry (immediate preceeding code chunk)

#spread data
ptm <- ptm %>% 
  spread(key, value) #not clever names, but appropriate

#gives a tibble of 645 observations, therefore 645 unique PTMs

#double check to see no duplicates
#get_dupes(ptm, id)

#more cleaning steps
ptm$MM <- as.numeric(ptm$MM)
ptm$MA <- as.numeric(ptm$MA)
ptm$KW <- str_replace(ptm$KW, "\\.", "") #need two \\ to mean literal "."
ptm$KW <- as.factor(ptm$KW)
ptm$FT <- str_trim(ptm$FT, side = "left") #use stringr pkg to remove white space
ptm$TG <- str_trim(ptm$TG, side = "left")
ptm$TG <- str_replace(ptm$TG, "\\.", "") #need two \\ to mean literal "."


#a little bit of eda
count(ptm, FT, sort = TRUE)
#should I include crosslinks? Or just modifications?

ptm %>%
  filter(!FT == "CROSSLNK") %>% #omit AA cross links only
  summarize(n = n())
#This code snippet give me the total number of unique modifications, with CROSSLINK removed; total is 498. But I know the list doens't include 3 recently published modifications discovered by our group, plus a few others by YMZ (considering this a lag in DB updating), so OK to conclude over 500.

count(ptm, KW, sort = TRUE) #number of modifications by keyword
#a lot of glycoproteins!

#ptm %>%
#  filter(FT == "MOD_RES") %>% #include only modified AAs, no cross links, no lipids, no glycoproteins?
#  count(TG, sort = TRUE) %>% #target (TG) is exactly what I need
#  mutate(TG = fct_reorder(TG, n)) %>% 
#  ggplot(aes(TG, n)) +
#  geom_col() +
#  coord_flip() +
#  labs(x = "") + 
#  expand_limits(y = 40)
#commented this out because it only includes modified AAs; not sure if this is useful

ptm %>%
  filter(!FT == "CROSSLNK") %>% #omit AA cross links only
  count(TG, sort = TRUE)

ptm %>%
  filter(!FT == "CROSSLNK") %>% #omit AA cross links only
  count(TG, FT, sort = TRUE) %>% #target (TG) is exactly what I need
  mutate(TG = fct_reorder2(TG, FT, n, .desc = FALSE)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(TG, n, fill = FT)) +

  coord_flip() +
  #labs(x = "", title = "Distribution of Modifications Across Amino Acids", caption = "Plot by @matthewhirschey | Data from @Uniprot") + 
  labs(x = "") +
  expand_limits(y = 80) +
  scale_fill_viridis(discrete = TRUE, direction = -1, option = "viridis", labels = c("Carbohydrate", "Lipid", "Modification"), name = "") +

```

##Figure 2
Goal is to determine how these modifications are distributed; thought it'd be interesting to visualize by average added mass (MA) to a protein, with several small changes in molecular mass, with some very large additions of mass
```{r}
ptm %>%
  filter(!FT == "CROSSLNK") %>% #omit AA cross links only
  ggplot(aes(x = MA, fill = FT)) +
  geom_dotplot(method = "dotdensity", stackgroups = TRUE, binpositions = "all", binwidth = 20, dotsize = 1.05) + #empircally determined bin width
  labs(x = "Average Mass Appended (Da)") +
  scale_fill_viridis(discrete = TRUE, direction = -1, option = "viridis", labels = c("Carbohydrate", "Lipid", "Modification"), name = "")+
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = c(0,100,200,300,400,500,600,700,800,900,1000), limits = c(0,1000)) +
  scale_y_continuous(breaks = c(0,10,20,30,40,50,60,70), limits = c(0,70)) + #manually scale y because of geom_dotplot limitations
  NULL

#save plot
ggsave("fig2.pdf", plot = last_plot(), width = 5, height = 5, dpi = 600)

#the reason some average masses (MA) are so abundant is because you find the same modifications across several AAs, thereby weighting some more
#NB several glycans and lipids are variable masses, and therefore are entered as NA, so not reflected in the graph

ptm %>%
  filter(!FT == "CROSSLNK") %>% #omit AA cross links only
  count(KW, sort = TRUE)

#would it be more interesting to fill by: amino acid, chemical property of AA (polar, non-polar, etc.), or by key word (KW) of modifiaction? Rather than by "type"?
```
##Note (lysine)
In this code chunk, the goal is to count and summarize lysine modifications.
```{r}
ptm %>% 
  filter(!FT == "CROSSLNK") %>% #omit AA cross links only
  filter(TG == "Lysine") %>% 
  count(ID, sort = TRUE)
```

##Figure 3
In this figure, the goal is to determine how many reactive [human] metabolites there are and to determine how many are associated with PTMs



#count thioesters
```{r}
thioester <- metabolites %>% 
  filter(str_detect(smiles, "C\\(=O\\)S") | str_detect(smiles, "SC\\(=O\\)")) %>% #regex the smiles code for thioesters at either orientation
  arrange(average_molecular_weight) %>% 
  mutate(type = "Thioester") %>% 
  mutate(pre_post = if_else(str_detect(smiles, "C\\(=O\\)S"), "pre", "post")) %>% 
  separate(smiles, into = c("pre_smiles", "post_smiles"), sep = "S", remove = FALSE, extra = "merge" ) %>%  #merge is to prevent discarding data "Expected 2 pieces. Additional pieces discarded in 26 rows"
  mutate(added_carbons = if_else(grepl("pre", pre_post), str_count(pre_smiles, "C"), str_count(post_smiles, "C")))

#because the smiles code has thioesters with orientations that could add carbon on either sides of the code, the first mutate adds a pre_post column to indicate which side will be added; then the separate will split at the thiol; then the last mutate will count the number of carbons in either the pre or post column, depending.

#these include all from CoA list, except "CoA-"
#anti_join(CoA, thioester, by = "name")
#semi_join(CoA, thioester, by = "name") leaves 355, which is one less than in the CoA df

#sum(str_count(thioester$smiles, "C\\(=O\\)S")) #346
#sum(str_count(thioester$smiles, "SC\\(=O\\)")) #80

#thioester$added_carbons <- as.factor(thioester$added_carbons)
ggplot(thioester) +
  geom_bar(aes(added_carbons))
```
#Merge thioesters and phosphates
```{r}
carbon <- full_join(thioester, phosphate)

#start thinking about how to quanity/overlay (fuzzyjoin?) whether PTM is known
sum(str_detect(carbon$name, "acetyl|Acetyl")) #this is complicated by ... or could be benefited by the notion that acetyl-mods can come from several types of metabolites
